# Scientific Calculator with Modular Python Architecture

This project is a scientific calculator implemented in Python with a modular architecture, separating different mathematical operations into individual files. 
The calculator provides a clean and scalable design, making it easy to extend and maintain. 
It supports basic arithmetic operations, trigonometry, powers, square roots, logarithmic functions, and displays mathematical constants.

###  ‚öôÔ∏è Features
Basic Arithmetic: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

Advanced Functions: Power, square root, and logarithmic calculations (base 10 and base 2).

Trigonometry: Calculate sine, cosine, and tangent for given angles.

Mathematical Constants: Displays constants like Pi, Euler‚Äôs number, and the golden ratio.

Modular Design: Each operation is in a separate Python file, promoting clean code and easy debugging.

Error Handling: Division by zero and invalid input checks prevent runtime errors.
